General Introduction:
Welcome to my GitHub repository. To summarise, this repository contains custom scripts for adaptavist. The scripts are divided into 2 Scripted Fields and a Custom Listener script.

---- Scope ----
The adaptavist files are mapped to the following issues:
1) Calculate_values is mapped to "A scripted field that calculates a value based on issue fields; (Tip: Create two
number fields"
2) Count_subtasks is mapped to "A scripted field that can count the number of sub-tasks in an issue;"
3) Update_issue_description is mapped to "A custom listener script that updates the issue description with the issue last
comment;"

The files are located at ./src/test/java/
